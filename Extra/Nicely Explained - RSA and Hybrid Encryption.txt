Esewa and Khalti (If you are only for RSA and Hybrid, you don't need to learn this. These two SDK is just used for example)

1) Get SDK keys and product details

2) Get transactionId

3) Verify transaction


AES
These is one secret key
say: key=12345

Sender
Receiver
Both have that  key

data ="Hello"

//Sender
data.encrypt(key)
//Sender can decrypt the data, or if sender mistakely exposes the key, the data gets leaked
Sends It

//Receiver
Receives it
data.decrypt(key)


------------------------
Sender
Public Key of Receiver (Sended by Receiver)



Receiver
Private Key of Receiver


Data=Hello
Public=public...
Private=private...

//Sender
Data.encrypt(public)
Sends it to the Receiver
//Even if public key get leaked, no one decrypt it because only receiver have the private key

//Receiver
Receives the encrypted data
encryptedData.decrypt(private)


Large data have error in RSA
What i found in flutter, chunking



----------------------------------
Hybrid Encryption Decryption for Large Data
-------------------------------------------
Sender
(Public Key of Receiver)

1) Sender creates a random AES key
2) Sender encrypt the "Large Data" and creates "Encrypted Large Data". This encryption is done using AES Key.
3) The AES Key Get Encrypted by the public key, now we got "EncryptedAES-DecryptionKey".
4) In response, Receiver sends the "Encrypted Large Data" and "EncryptedAES-DecryptionKey" to the Receiver.
5) Its also good to send meta data. as per chat gpt


Receiver
(Private Key of Receiver)
1) Receiver receives "Encrypted Large Data" and "EncryptedAES-DecryptionKey" from the Sender
2) Using its Private Key , it decrypt the "EncryptedAES-DecryptionKey", and gets the generated AES key.
3) Using that AES key, the "Encrypted Large Data" gets decrypted.
4) We got the Decrypted "Large Data"


----------------------------------


In my response there were two data:
1) Data of Esewa -> Hybrid Encryption
2) Data of Khalti -> Rsa Encryption

Without IV

Hacker got 12345 is ABCDE

A user password is 12345,
Hacker hacked the API and Found the encrypted data ABCDE

Now since 12345 which hacker found denotes ABCDE,
and the user password encypted is also ABCDE,
so the user passord is 12345
Hence HACKED!!
----------------------------------
Without IV

Hacker got 12345 is ABCDE

A user password is 12345 -> EFGHI or FJDKLF or KDJFDF or KFDKLSJF, It would be different not same every time it would be encrypted.
Hacker hacked the API and Found the encrypted data KDJFDF

Now since 12345 which hacker found denotes ABCDE,
and the user password encypted is acually encypted as KDJFDF,

So hacker cannot know that its 12345
