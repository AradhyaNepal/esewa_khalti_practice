Large data Encryption using Hybrid Stretegy
-------------------------------------------

Server
------
Code generates Random Symmetric key.
Using that Symmetric key, code encrypt large data.
That Symmetric key gets encrypted using Client Public Key.
In response server sends back both EncryptedLargeDataUsingSymmetricKey and EncryptedSymmetricKey


Client
------
Using Client Private Key EncryptedSymmetricKey get decrypted, now client got the SymmetricKey.

Using the SymmetricKey, EncryptedLargeDataUsingSymmetricKey gets decrypted.
And the client gets the LargeData

Large data

I will do chuking and padding <- I know nothing about it
And encrypt <- It could be inefficent i don't know
combine
sends in response
